# SentimentAnalysis
Sentiment analysis on Social Media. 
In this project I used sklearn classifiers,recurrent neural networks and 
the Transformer architecture to build sentiment analysis prediction models for social media posts. 
I had to deal with scarce data and classes imbalance problems. 
I used python libraries: sklearn, pandas, matplotlib and tensorflow.
